todoer is a simple tool for tracking todo items, primarily as a way
of experimenting with tsapp, but it is useful too. 

It simply creates appropriately tagged tiddlers and lists those that 
are there.

The hope here is that someone will see just how easy this stuff is
and make a good todo application, using modern JavaScript libraries
and skillz.

If you wish to experiment with using todoer and tsapp together do the
following:

* install tsapp: `pip install -U tsapp`
* clone this repo
* cd into the repo
* run `tsapp serve`
* open your browser to `http://0.0.0.0:8080/todoer.html`

Note that without additional configuration, your actions will be readonly.
